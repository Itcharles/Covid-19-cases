This project involves analyzing COVID-19 data using SQL queries to gain insights into the pandemic's impact from 2020 to 2024. The analysis focuses on several key areas:

1. **Global COVID-19 Statistics**: The first query provides a summary of global COVID-19 numbers, including total cases, total deaths, and the death percentage.
   This overview gives a high-level understanding of the severity and fatality rate of the pandemic worldwide.

2. **Total Deaths by Continent**: The second query breaks down the total number of deaths by continent, allowing us to see the impact of COVID-19 across different regions.
    By ordering the results by the total death count in descending order, we can identify which continents were hardest hit by the pandemic.

3. **Infection Rates and Percentages by Country**: The third query focuses on the infection rates in each country, along with the percentage of the population that has been infected.
   This detailed analysis helps to understand how the virus spread in different countries and the proportion of each country's population that was affected.

4. **Daily Infection Rates by Country**: The fourth query drills down into the data on a daily basis, showing the number of people infected and the percentage of the population
   infected each day. This allows for a granular view of the pandemic's spread over time within each country.

Together, these queries offer a comprehensive look at the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on a global scale, by continent, by country, and over time.

Original data is in excel format.
Queries were written in mysql environment.
Visualization has been made in Tableau.
Alternatively I transformed SQL queries into code Python by using pandas library.
